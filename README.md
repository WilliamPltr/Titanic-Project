# Titanic-Project
2024-June Project in the class "Programming For Data Science"

Welcome to our program's guide !

This guide will help you to run each section of the program.

In the folder you received, you can find 2 python files, one Module.py, and one Main.py.

In order to execute them, open them in a python environment, and you should run the Main.py file from you Windows PowerShell, with, Main.py as the first argument.

For the second argument it is intuitive write :
- "Task1" to execute the task 1
- "Task2" to execute the task 2
- "Task3.1" to execute the task the first point of task 3
- "Task3.2" to execute the task the second point of task 3
- "Task3.3" to execute the task the third point of task 3
- "Task3.4" to execute the task the fourth point of task 3
- "Task4" to execute the task 4
(we didn't divide the task 4 because it's better for a neural network to not be executed by part)

For example, if you want the correlation matrix, type >Python3 Main.py Task3.3

You just have to enjoy the work !
